# React Router Tutorials

Welcome to the **React Router Tutorials** repository! This repository contains multiple examples and detailed explanations to help you learn and master the latest version of React Router. It is organized into three main modes of usage:

1. **Declarative Mode**: Understand basic routing features like matching URLs to components, navigating around the app, and providing active states with APIs like <Link>, useNavigate, and useLocation.
2. **Data Mode**: Explore how to handle data loading, actions, and routing seamlessly with React Router.
3. **Framework Mode**: Learn how to integrate React Router as a core part of your React application. Framework Mode wraps Data Mode with a Vite plugin to add the full React Router experience with:
  - **Typesafe href**
  - **Typesafe Route Module API**
  - **Intelligent code splitting**
  - **SPA, SSR, and static rendering strategies**
  - And more

Each mode is covered in its own folder with examples, code snippets, and explanations to guide you through the concepts.

## Choosing the Right Mode

Not sure which mode to use? Here's a quick guide to help you decide:

- **Declarative Mode**: Ideal for simple applications or when you want to focus on basic routing without worrying about data management or advanced features.
- **Data Mode**: Best suited for apps that require seamless data fetching, mutations, and routing integration. Use this mode when your app needs to handle complex data workflows.
- **Framework Mode**: Ideal for applications that require advanced features like server-side rendering (SSR), static rendering, and intelligent code splitting. If you're coming from frameworks like Astro or Next.js.
