# React Router Declarative Example

This example demonstrates the declarative mode of React Router. Declarative mode is similar to the previous versions of React Router and is ideal if you prefer to use your own libraries for state management, data fetching, or other tools. In this mode, React Router functions purely as a router, providing components like `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `<Outlet />`, and hooks such as `useParams`, `useNavigate`, and `useSearchParams`.

For a detailed overview of the features available in declarative mode, refer to the [React Router API and Mode Availability Table](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes#api--mode-availability-table).

## Installation

To use this mode, install the React Router library:

```bash
npm install react-router
```

Follow these steps to run the example:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
  Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
